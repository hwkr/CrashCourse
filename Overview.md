# Web Development 101

This is going to be an overview of web development from zero to start.

* You probably won't remember everything, that's okay

## The Internets

A long long time ago Bill Gates and Steve Jobs wanted to send dank memes to each other so they created the internet.

Just kidding.

### The World Wide Web

* HTTP, HTML and URLs

**URL:** Uniform Resource Locator. The global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web.

**HTTP:** Hypertext Transfer Protocol. *Hypertext* is text or documents which contains links between documents.

**HTML:** Hypertext Mockup Language. The standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.

#### HTTP

Uses requests, `get`,`post`, ...

Here's an example of a `get` request,

```
GET /CrashCourse/ HTTP/1.1
Host: hwkr.github.io
Connection: keep-alive
Cache-Control: max-age=0

## HTML & CSS

### HTML

* HTML = *Hypertext* Markup Language

  * Block vs Inline
  * Self Closing
  * Attributes
* [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)
* IDs and Classes
  * From MDN: "The ID name must be unique in the document."

### CSS

* Selectors
  * Select IDs with `#` and classes with `.`. 
  * `*` is everything
  * `a b` is any descendant
  * `a > b` is a direct child
* Properties
